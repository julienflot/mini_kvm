# Mini KVM architecture

Mini is designed to run simple and lightweight Linux vital machines. 
This project is toy project that is used to learn about Operating systems, C and Linux programming, and a bunch of other things.
This file is here to remind me how did I organized the code structure and which design choice have made (and possibly why for avoiding looking at my code and say "why did I wrote that ... 30min later .. Oh that is why").
